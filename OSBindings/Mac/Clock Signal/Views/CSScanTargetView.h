	Although I'm still on the fence about this as a design decision, CSScanTargetView is itself responsible
	for creating and destroying a CVDisplayLink. There's a practical reason for this: you'll get real synchronisation
	only if a link is explicitly tied to a particular display, and the CSScanTargetView therefore owns the knowledge
	necessary to decide when to create and modify them. It doesn't currently just propagate "did change screen"-type
	messages because I haven't yet found a way to track that other than polling, in which case I might as well put
	that into the display link callback.
