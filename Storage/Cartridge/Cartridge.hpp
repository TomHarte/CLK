	Provides a base class for cartridges; the bus provided to cartridges and therefore

	summaries of the contents of emulator files that themselves describe cartridges.

	Consumers will almost certainly seek to dynamic_cast to something more appropriate,
	however some cartridge container formats have no exposition beyond the ROM dump,
	making the base class 100% descriptive.
