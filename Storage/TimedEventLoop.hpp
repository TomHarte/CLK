	/*!
		Provides a mechanism for arbitrarily timed events to be processed according to a fixed-base
		discrete clock signal, ensuring correct timing.

		Subclasses are responsible for calling @c set_next_event_time_interval to establish the time
		until a next event; @c process_next_event will be called when that event occurs, with progression
		determined via @c run_for_cycles.

		Due to the aggregation of total timing information between events — e.g. if an event loop has
		a clock rate of 1000 ticks per second and a steady stream of events that occur 10,000 times a second,
		bookkeeping is necessary to ensure that 10 events are triggered per tick — subclasses should call
		@c reset_timer if there is a discontinuity in events.

		Subclasses may also call @c jump_to_next_event to cause the next event to be communicated instantly.

		Subclasses are therefore expected to call @c set_next_event_time_interval upon obtaining an event stream,
		and again in response to each call to @c process_next_event while events are ongoing. They may use
		@c reset_timer to initiate a distinctly-timed stream or @c jump_to_next_event to short-circuit the timing
		loop and fast forward immediately to the next event.
