			Describes a token found in the incoming PLL bit stream. Tokens can be one of:

				Index: the bit pattern usually encoded at the start of a track to denote the position of the index hole;
				ID: the pattern that begins an ID section, i.e. a sector header, announcing sector number, track number, etc.
				Data: the pattern that begins a data section, i.e. sector contents.
				DeletedData: the pattern that begins a deleted data section, i.e. deleted sector contents.

				Sync: MFM only; the same synchronisation mark is used in MFM to denote the bottom three of the four types
				of token listed above; this class combines notification of that mark and the distinct index sync mark.
				Both are followed by a byte to indicate type. When scanning an MFM stream, subclasses will receive an
				announcement of sync followed by an announcement of one of the above four types of token.

				Byte: reports reading of an ordinary byte, with expected timing bits.

			When the data mode is set to 'reading', only Byte tokens are returned; detection of the other kinds of token
			is suppressed. Controllers will likely want to switch data mode when receiving ID and sector contents, as
			spurious sync signals can otherwise be found in ordinary data, causing framing errors.
