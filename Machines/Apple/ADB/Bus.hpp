	The ADB bus models the data line of the ADB bus; it allows multiple devices to
	post their current data level, or read the current level, and also offers a tokenised
	version of all activity on the bus.

	In implementation terms, two types of device are envisaged:

		* proactive devices, which use @c add_device() and then merely @c set_device_output
		and @c get_state() as required, according to their own tracking of time; and

		* reactive devices, which use @c add_device(Device*) and then merely react to
		@c adb_bus_did_observe_event and @c advance_state in order to
		update @c set_device_output.
