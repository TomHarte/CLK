/*!
	This provides a small subset of the interface offered to cards installed in
	an Apple II, oriented pragmatically around the cards that are implemented.

	The main underlying rule is as it is elsewhere in the emulator: no
	_inaccurate_ simplifications â€” no provision of information that shouldn't
	actually commute, no interfaces that say they do one thing but which by both
	both sides are coupled through an unwritten understanding of abuse.

	Special notes:

		Devices that announce a select constraint, being interested in acting only
		when their IO or Device select is active will receive just-in-time @c run_for
		notifications, as well as being updated at the end of each of the Apple's
		@c run_for periods, prior to a @c flush.

		Devices that do not announce a select constraint will prima facie receive a
		@c perform_bus_operation every cycle. They'll also receive a @c flush.
		It is **highly** recomended that such devices also implement @c Sleeper
		as they otherwise prima facie require a virtual method call every
		single cycle.
