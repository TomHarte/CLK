	This file defines how the CPU-controlled part of a bus looks for the 6502 and
	for other processors with a sufficiently-similar bus.

	I'm not yet a big fan of the name I've used here, and I'm still on the fence
	about what to do when eventually I get around to the 6800 and/or 6809, which have
	very similar bus characteristics.

	So: this is _very_ provisional stuff.
