/*!
	A microcycle is an atomic unit of 68000 bus activity — it is a single item large enough
	fully to specify a sequence of bus events that occur without any possible interruption.

	Concretely, a standard read cycle breaks down into at least two microcycles:

		1) a 4 half-cycle length microcycle in which the address strobe is signalled; and
		2) a 4 half-cycle length microcycle in which at least one of the data strobes is
		signalled, and the data bus is sampled.

	That is, assuming DTack were signalled when microcycle (1) ended. If not then additional
	wait state microcycles would fall between those two parts.

	The 68000 data sheet defines when the address becomes valid during microcycle (1), and
	when the address strobe is actually asserted. But those timings are fixed. So simply
	telling you that this was a microcycle during which the address trobe was signalled is
	sufficient fully to describe the bus activity.

	(Aside: see the 68000 template's definition for options re: implicit DTack; if your
	68000 owner can always predict exactly how long it will hold DTack following observation
	of an address-strobing microcycle, it can just supply those periods for accounting and
	avoid the runtime cost of actual DTack emulation. But such as the bus allows.)

namespace CPU::MC68000 {

/*!
	Provides an emulation of the 68000 with accurate bus logic via the @c BusHandler, subject to the following template parameters:

	@c dtack_is_implicit means that the 68000 won't wait around for DTACK during any data access. BERR or VPA may still be
		signalled at the appropriate moment and will override the implicit DTACK, but the processor won't spin if nothing is explicitly
		signalled. Enabling this simplifies the internal state machine and therefore improves performance; bus handlers can still indicate
		that time was spent waiting for DTACK by returning an appropriate value from @c perform_bus_operation.

	@c permit_overrun allows the 68000 to be relaxed in how it interprets the constraint specified by the @c duration parameter to
		@c run_for. If this is @c false, @c run_for will always return as soon as it has called @c perform_bus_operation with whichever
		operation is ongoing at the requested stopping time. If it is @c true then the 68000 is granted leeway to overrun the requested stop
		time by 'a small amount' as and when it is a benefit to do so. Any overrun will be subtracted from the next @c run_for.

		In practice this allows the implementation to avoid a bunch of conditional checks by considering whether it needs to exit less frequently.

		Teleologically, it's expected that most — if not all — single-processor machines can permit overruns for a performance boost with
		no user-visible difference.

	@c signal_will_perform indicates whether the 68000 will call the bus handler's @c will_perform. Unlike the popular 8-bit CPUs,
		the 68000 doesn't offer an indication of when instruction dispatch will occur so this is provided *for testing purposes*. It allows test cases
		to track execution and inspect internal state in a wholly unrealistic fashion.
