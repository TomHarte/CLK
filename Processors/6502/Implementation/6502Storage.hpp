			This emulation functions by decomposing instructions into micro programs, consisting of the micro operations
			defined by MicroOp. Each micro op takes at most one cycle. By convention, those called CycleX take a cycle
			to perform whereas those called OperationX occur for free (so, in effect, their cost is loaded onto the next cycle).

			This micro-instruction set was put together in a fairly ad hoc fashion, I'm afraid, so is unlikely to be optimal.
