namespace Serial {

/*!
	Models one of two connections, either:

		(i) a plain single-line serial; or
		(ii) a two-line data + clock.

	In both cases connects a single reader to a single writer.

	When operating as a single-line serial connection:

		Provides a mechanism for the writer to enqueue levels arbitrarily far
		ahead of the current time, which are played back only as the
		write queue advances. Permits the reader and writer to work at
		different clock rates, and provides a virtual delegate protocol with
		start bit detection.

		Can alternatively be used by reader and/or writer only in immediate
		mode, getting or setting the current level now, without the actor on
		the other end having to have made the same decision.

	When operating as a two-line connection:

		Implies a clock over enqueued data and provides the reader with
		all enqueued bits at appropriate times.
