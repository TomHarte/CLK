			For the current line, scan then occurs from [_retrace_time, _expected_next_sync), at which point
			retrace begins and the internal counter is reset.

			All synchronisation events that occur within (-_sync_error_window, _sync_error_window) of the
			expected synchronisation time will cause a proportional adjustment in the expected time for the next
			synchronisation. Other synchronisation events are clamped as though they occurred in that range.
