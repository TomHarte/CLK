A brief user's guide to the newer features of EmuDesk, the EmuTOS desktop
=========================================================================

The current version of EmuDesk is based on the TOS 1 desktop, but with
many improvements inspired by the TOS 2/3/4 desktop, including:

1) new menu items
    . set file mask
    . install icon
    . install application
    . install devices
    . remove desktop icon
    . desktop configuration
    . blitter
Due to space limitations, the implementation of the above is somewhat
restricted in the 192K ROMs (see the detailed descriptions below).  If
you make any changes to the desktop using the above features, you must
save the desktop to preserve the changes.

2) other new features
    . user-assignable icons
    . user-assignable mouse cursors
    . open disk window via keyboard shortcut
    . desktop shortcuts
Due to space limitations, desktop shortcuts are not available in the
192K ROMs.  Desktop shortcuts are preserved when you save the desktop.


Set file mask
=============
192K ROMs:
This is not available.

Other ROMs:
This is used to change the file mask of the currently-topped window, to
control which files are displayed within the window.  Note that folders
are always displayed; the mask affects the display of files only.  The
default file mask when a window is opened is "*.*"


Install icon
============
192K ROMs:
This may be used to associate a specific icon with a desktop item (disk
or trash).  You may select an existing desktop item and click on "Install
icon...", or you may click on "Install icon..." with no item selected.
If you click on a window icon (file or folder), it will be ignored.

Other ROMs:
This may be used to associate a specific icon with a desktop item (disk
or trash), or a window item (file or folder).  You may select an existing
icon and click on "Install icon...", or you may click on "Install icon..."
with no item selected.  In the latter case, you'll get a dialog requesting
you to select the type of icon (desktop or window).

. Installing a desktop icon
  You may select the type (drive or trash), the label (displayed beneath
  it on the desktop), and the icon shape (use the up & down arrows to
  scroll through the available shapes).  In addition, for drives you can
  select the drive letter.

. Installing a window icon
  If you pre-selected an icon, you may only change the shape of the icon
  for that specific file or folder.  If you did not pre-select an item,
  you can select the files that the icon will apply to (standard TOS
  wildcards may be used), the type of item (file or folder), and the icon
  shape.  In either case, to change the icon shape, use the up & down
  arrows to scroll through the available shapes.


Install application
===================
The basic purpose of "Install application..." is to link an application
to data files with a specified extension.  After you have done this, when
you use the desktop to open a file with the specified extension, the
corresponding application is launched.  For example, you could associate
all .TXT files with a text editor; then, double-clicking on a .TXT file
would automatically launch the editor.

In addition, you can assign a function key to an application; pressing
the function key at the desktop will then launch the application.

Finally, you can set "autoboot" for one application (only): this will
launch that application during system initialisation, immediately before
the desktop itself runs.

To use "Install application...", highlight one or more applications and
click on "Install application...".  In the dialog box, the application
name of the first application selected will be prefilled.  The following
fields and buttons specify in detail how the application is run:

. Arguments
  If you need to pass information (in addition to the name of the data
  file) to the application when it starts, you may specify it here.  This
  is typically only relevant to utility programs, and the information
  needed will be in the application documentation.  In most cases, you
  should leave this blank.

. Document type
  This specifies the extension to associate with this application, for
  example TXT or RSC, and is required.  Wildcards are allowed.

. Install as F__
  This specifies the function key that will launch the application;
  values from 1 to 20 are allowed (11-20 are shift-F1 through shift-F10).
  Leaving this blank is valid, and means that no function key will launch
  the application.

. Boot status
  Select "Auto" to autoboot this application (see above).  Since only one
  autoboot application is allowed, if you set "Auto" for an application,
  EmuTOS will automatically disable "Auto" for any existing autoboot
  application.

. Application type
  Selecting TOS or TTP will launch the program in character mode; GEM or
  GTP will launch the application in graphics mode.  The appropriate
  value will be prefilled according to the type of application selected,
  and should not normally be changed.

. Default dir
  This specifies the default directory when the application is launched:
  either the directory of the application itself, or the top window (i.e.
  the directory of the data file).  The one to choose depends on the
  specific application.  If the application has supporting files (such as
  resource or help files), it typically will look for them in the default
  directory.  For such an application, you will need to specify a default
  directory of "Application".  Otherwise, specify "Window".

. Parameter
  When a program is launched due to it being an installed application,
  the desktop provides the application with the name of the data file
  that caused the launch: this is known as a parameter.  In most cases,
  the application expects that the full path of the data file will be
  provided.  Some (usually older) programs may expect the filename only.
  Unless the application's documentation indicates otherwise, you should
  normally try "Full path" first; if that does not work, you can try
  "File name", although that may require you to modify the "Default dir"
  specified above.

At the bottom of the dialog box are the following exit buttons:

. Install
  Installs the application.  You must save the desktop afterwards if you
  want the change to be saved across boots.

. Remove
  Removes an existing installed application.  You must save the desktop
  afterwards if you want the change to be saved across boots.

. Skip
  Skips installing/removing the current application, and moves on to the
  next one you specified.  If you only specified one application, this
  is the same as Cancel.

. Cancel
  Skip installing/removing all remaining applications.


Install devices
===============
This automatically installs icons for all devices that are currently
known to GEMDOS (have an entry in _drvbits) and that do not currently
have an icon.  If the device is A: or B:, a floppy icon is installed;
otherwise a hard disk icon is installed.


Remove desktop icon
===================
This is used to remove a disk or trash icon.  Highlight the icon you
wish to remove, and click on "Remove desktop icon".


Desktop configuration
=====================
192K ROMs:
This is not available.

Other ROMs:
This is a simplified version of the corresponding Atari TOS menu item.
It allows you to specify the default directory and input parameter for
all applications that are not installed applications.  See "Install
application" above, under 'Default dir' and 'Parameter', for further
information about these options.


Blitter
=======
This item allows you to enable or disable the use of the blitter by the
desktop.  The item is greyed-out if the system does not have a blitter.


User-assignable icons
=====================
When EmuDesk starts, it looks for a file called EMUICON.RSC in the root
of the boot drive.  This file should be a standard Atari resource file,
with at least eight icons.  All icons in the file must be 32x32-pixel
monochrome icons.  If the file is found, these icons are used for the
desktop and window displays; if not found, a standard set of eight
builtin icons is used instead.  The builtin icons (or the first eight
of the loaded icons, if EMUICON.RSC is in use) have the following usage:
    0   hard drive
    1   floppy drive
    2   folder
    3   trash
    4   printer
    5   removable disk
    6   generic application icon
    7   generic document icon
Icons 8 and above can be used as you wish.

Note that, for historical reasons, these assignments are different from
those used by Atari TOS, so if you have an equivalent RSC file that works
with Atari TOS, you will need to move the icons around to get the same
desktop display.

A default EMUICON.RSC file (currently containing 41 icons) is shipped
with the release; the first 8 icons are the same as the builtin ones.
Also shipped is the corresponding EMUICON.DEF file for use by a resource
editor.  You should be aware that each icon consumes about 300 bytes of
RAM, so if you are short of memory, avoid putting too many icons in
EMUICON.RSC.


User-assignable mouse cursors
=============================
When the AES starts, it looks for a file called EMUCURS.RSC in the root
of the boot drive.  This file should be a standard Atari resource file,
containing 8 ICONBLKs; each ICONBLK is a container for a mouse cursor.
If the file is found, these cursors are used instead of the builtin
cursors.  The usage is as described for the AES graf_mouse() call:
    0   arrow
    1   text cursor / i-beam
    2   busy bee / hourglass
    3   pointing hand
    4   flat hand
    5   thin cross
    6   thick cross
    7   outline cross

A default EMUCURS.RSC file is shipped with the release; the mouse cursors
in it are the same as the builtin ones.  Also shipped is the corresponding
EMUCURS.DEF file for use by a resource editor.

NOTE: Because the mouse cursors are not really ICONBLKs (though they are
stored as such within the resource), editing them with a standard resource
editor is difficult.  Thorsten Otto's ORCS resource editor has special
support for mouse cursors and is the recommended tool for modifying them.


Open disk window via keyboard shortcut
======================================
You may now use a keyboard shortcut to display the root directory of a
drive in a new window.  To display drive X, hold the Alt key down and
type X, e.g. Alt-C displays drive C, Alt-D displays drive D, and so on.
As in TOS2/3/4, these shortcuts are permanently assigned and cannot be
changed by the user.

NOTE: unlike TOS2/3/4, shortcuts with the Ctrl modifier do NOT update
the drive assigned to the currently topped window; instead, they are
assigned to menu item shortcuts.  At the moment, these assignments are
also permanent.


Desktop shortcuts
=================
You may now drag a file or folder to the desktop to create a desktop icon
that is a shortcut to the original file/folder: manipulating the icon
will have the same effect as manipulating the original file or folder.
For example, it may be opened, copied, or moved or deleted; it may have
an "Info/rename" performed on it.  Currently, by design, the shortcut is
NOT updated automatically if the original file or folder is moved or
deleted.

The name and shape of the shortcut icon itself may be modified by the
"Install icon" menu item; this does not change the name of the file or
folder that the icon points to.  The shortcut icon may be deleted by the
"Remove icon" menu item.  To preserve shortcut information across boots,
you must save the desktop.

You may drag a file or folder to a desktop shortcut, with the following
results:
. dragging documents to a desktop shortcut for a folder will copy (or
  move, if the control key is held down) them to the folder
. dragging documents to a desktop shortcut for a program will launch the
  program, passing the full pathname of the first document
. dragging documents to a desktop shortcut for a non-executable file will
  do nothing

If you open a desktop shortcut that points to a file or folder that no
longer exists, an alert will be issued, giving you the choice of removing
the shortcut, locating the desired file or folder, or cancelling the
action.  If you choose locate, a file selector will be displayed to
allow you to choose the desired file or folder, and the shortcut will be
updated with the new information.
