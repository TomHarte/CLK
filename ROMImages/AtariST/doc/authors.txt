EmuTOS source code consists of several parts, and includes code taken from
other projects - Many thanks to them and to their authors for releasing the
code under GPL.

The 'historical' authors - those who wrote the code before the start of the
EmuTOS project - are mentioned in the individual files they've authored.
Major 'historical' parts are:
- BDOS, VDI - both come from the latest known GEMDOS version from
  Digital Research (later versions seem to have been developed by Atari).
- AES, desktop - The C source code for GEM comes from the x86 version.
- Some GEM assembler files come from the AES for the Apple LISA.

All these historical parts were released under the General Public License
by Caldera, Inc. in mid april 2000 (?)  (For the record, Caldera bought it
from Novell in 1997 along with DR-DOS; later Caldera disappeared and this
is the copyright notice that refers to Lineo)

Minor borrowed stuff:
- the printf and memcpy stuff is inspired by the Minix kernel and library;
- the processor/FPU detection is taken from the MiNT kernel;
- "Bug" includes parts of the original gettext source code;
- some low-level hardware stuff comes from the Linux kernel;

While the main Amiga support was written from scratch by the EmuTOS team,
some advanced code (FastRAM support for ROM versions) has been borrowed from the
AROS project. Due to license incompatibilities, that code is shipped in the
source archive, but not compiled into the official binaries.

The following is a list of 'recent' contributors - individuals involved in the
EmuTOS project. In this project virtually everybody modifies every file;
nevertheless here is an attempt at identifying who's guilty of what:
