ROMs for the MSX go here; the copyright status of these is uncertain so they have not been included in this repository.

Minimum expected files:

msx.rom
msx2.rom
msx2ext.rom
disk.rom

These names match those offered for download at http://fms.komkon.org/fMSX/ (albeit in lowercase), and the emulator has been tested against those images.

You may also provide one or more of:

msx-japanese.rom
msx-european.com
msx-american.rom

If one of these files exists, it will be used as the BIOS for machines of that region. If the file does not exist, the emulator will load msx.rom and alter its region identification bytes appropriately.
