ROM files would ordinarily go here; the copyright status of these is uncertain so they have not been included in this repository.

Expected files:

basic.rom
os.rom
DFS-1770-2.20.rom	— used only if the user opens a DFS disk image
ADFS-E00_1.rom		— used only if the user opens an ADFS disk image
ADFS-E00_2.rom
AP6v133.rom			— used only if the user opens a disk image that makes use of any of the commands given below.

Possibly to be desired in the future:
* adfs.rom
* ElectronExpansionRomPresAP2-v1.23.rom
* os300.rom

* *AQRPAGE
