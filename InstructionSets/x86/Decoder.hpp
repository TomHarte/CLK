		@returns an @c Instruction plus a size; a positive size indicates successful decoding of

			minimum number of further bytes the caller should ideally collect before calling again. The
			caller is free to call with fewer, but may not get a decoded instruction in response, and the
			decoder may still not be able to complete decoding even if given that number of bytes.

			Successful decoding is defined to mean that all decoding steps are complete. The output
			may still be an illegal instruction (indicated by Operation::Invalid), if the byte sequence
			supplied cannot form a valid instruction.

		@discussion although instructions also contain an indicator of their length, on chips prior
			to the 80286 there is no limit to potential instruction length.

			The 80286 and 80386 have instruction length limits of 10 and 15 bytes respectively, so
			cannot overflow the field.
