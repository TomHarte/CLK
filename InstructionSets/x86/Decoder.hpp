				minimum number of further bytes the caller should ideally collect before calling again. The
				caller is free to call with fewer, but may not get a decoded instruction in response, and the
				decoder may still not be able to complete decoding even if given that number of bytes.

				Successful decoding is defined to mean that all decoding steps are complete. The output
				may still be an illegal instruction (indicated by Operation::Invalid), if the byte sequence
				supplied cannot form a valid instruction.

			@discussion although instructions also contain an indicator of their length, on chips prior
				to the 80286 there is no limit to potential instruction length.

				The 80286 and 80386 have instruction length limits of 10 and 15 bytes respectively, so
				cannot overflow the field.
